# Project: Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

I am thrilled to share with you an exciting project where I explored the application of Machine Learning techniques to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on various factors. Utilizing powerful tools such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

## Usage Instructions:
Dependency Installation:
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

# Project Description:
This project comprises a Python script named `titanic_survival_prediction.py`, which performs the following tasks:

1. Importing necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
2. Reading data from the Titanic dataset.
3. Preprocessing the data by splitting it into training and testing sets and normalizing features.
4. Building different machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, KNN, SVM, and Xtreme Gradient Boosting.
5. Training and evaluating each model on the training and testing data.
6. Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
